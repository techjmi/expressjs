Middleware can perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, parsing request bodies, etc. This modular approach makes it easy to add, remove, or modify functionality in the request-response cycle.

 Routing:

Routing System: Express provides a simple and effective routing mechanism. You can define routes for different HTTP methods and URL patterns, making it easy to organize and handle various parts of your application.
